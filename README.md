# MCQ Generation using LLM

Generating Multi-Choices Questions (MCQ) that evaluates diverse knowledge of the test takers is often 
very challenging and time-consuming task. Large Language Models (LLMs) hold a promising method that can 
be useful while meeting the objectives of the MCQ.

### Key Features

#### 1. Flexible Model Selection
Choose between OpenAI's GPT models or the open-source Ollama framework to suit your needs, whether you're looking for performance, cost-efficiency, or specific use cases.

#### 2. Customizable Question Generation
Tailor your quiz to perfection with these options:
- **Subject/Specialization**: Input your area of interest.
- **Difficulty Level**: Select from Easy, Medium, or Hard.
- **Number of Questions**: Choose how many questions you want to generate.
- **Maximum Token Limit**: Adjust the length of responses and explanations.

#### 3. Comprehensive Question Analysis
For every generated question, users can:
- **Check the Correct Answer**: Instantly verify the solution.
- **Request a Detailed Explanation**: Gain insights into why the answer is correct or incorrect.
- **Access Prerequisite Knowledge**: Understand any foundational concepts needed for the question.
- **Translate the Question**: Convert the question to different languages (currently supporting English and Hindi).

#### 4. Intelligent Caching
Our caching system optimizes performance by minimizing redundant API calls. If a question's explanation, prerequisites, or translation has been generated before, the system retrieves it instantly from memory.

#### 5. Unique Question Identification
Each generated question is assigned a unique identifier, making it easy to track, reference, and reuse specific questions. This identifier includes the specialization and a counter for easy question management.
