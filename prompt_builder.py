        Cover a wide range of subtopics within the specialization, including both theoretical concepts and practical real-world applications.
        The questions should reflect the variety of topics that may appear in competitive examinations and educational assessments.
        
        Ensure that each question is based on factual information that can be verified using reliable sources such as textbooks, academic papers, or well-known websites (e.g., government or university websites). Avoid speculative or opinion-based content.
        
        All questions must be unambiguous, with clear language that leaves no room for misinterpretation.
        
        Ensure the questions and options are unbiased, free from any cultural, racial, or gender bias, and are appropriate for diverse audiences.

        Each question MUST be unique, and have exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D), with only one correct answer. Format each question as follows:

        Question: [Question text]
        A. [Option A]
        B. [Option B]
        C. [Option C]
        D. [Option D]
        Correct Answer: [A/B/C/D]

        Ensure that the options are plausible, and avoid trivial or obviously incorrect answers. Include real-world context where relevant, and ensure that all questions are diverse, covering different aspects of {specialization}."""
